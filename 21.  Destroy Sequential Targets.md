### 2453. Destroy Sequential Targets

You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers, representing targets on a number line. You are also given an integer space.

You have a machine which can destroy targets. Seeding the machine with some nums[i] allows it to destroy all targets with values that can be represented as nums[i] + c * space, where c is any non-negative integer. You want to destroy the maximum number of targets in nums.

Return the minimum value of nums[i] you can seed the machine with to destroy the maximum number of targets.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,7,8,1,1,5], space = 2  
Output: 1  
Explanation: If we seed the machine with nums[3], then we destroy all targets equal to 1,3,5,7,9,...   
In this case, we would destroy 5 total targets (all except for nums[2]).   
It is impossible to destroy more than 5 targets, so we return nums[3].  


Example 2: 

Input: nums = [1,3,5,2,4,6], space = 2  
Output: 1  
Explanation: Seeding the machine with nums[0], or nums[3] destroys 3 targets.   
It is not possible to destroy more than 3 targets.  
Since nums[0] is the minimal integer that can destroy 3 targets, we return 1.    

Example 3:

Input: nums = [6,2,5], space = 100  
Output: 2  
Explanation: Whatever initial seed we select, we can only destroy 1 target. The minimal seed is nums[1].  

Constraints:  
  
1 <= nums.length <= 105  
1 <= nums[i] <= 109  
1 <= space <= 109  

## Approach -  

it is given that we can destroy an element y from nums[i] if and only if :  y = nums[i] + c*space , where c is any non-negative integer.  
Solving this equation :   
            y = nums[i] + c * space  
            y-nums[i] = c*space   
            (y-nums[i])/space = c,    
            since c is any non-negative integer which means it could be 0 or any positive integer.  
            Here is a catch i.e. if c is any positive integer it means that y-nums[i] must be a multiple of space.   
            Since y-nums[i] is a multiple of space then if we will find the modulo of y-nums[i] by space then it will be 0 (beacause it is a multiple).  
            So, writting the equation -   
            (y-nums[i])%space = 0  
            y%space - nums[i]%space = 0  
            y%space = nums[i]%space   

Now, think that, if the remainder of any two number is same then those number can be represented in the given format.  
Hence, find the remainder and corresponding frequency.   
Find the maximum frequency  
Now, find the element whose remainder's frequency is maximum. Since multiple element can have same remainder, so find the minimum element whose remainder's freq is maximum.

### Java code

```
class Solution {
    public int destroyTargets(int[] nums, int space) {
        // map to store remainder-frequency
        HashMap<Integer,Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); 
        int maxFreq=0;
        for(int n : nums){
            int rem = n%space;
            map.put(rem,map.getOrDefault(rem,0)+1);
            maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq,map.get(rem));
        }
        // find element whose remainder's frequency is maximum
        int min=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int n : nums){
            int rem = n%space;
            if(map.get(rem)==maxFreq){
                min=Math.min(min,n);
            }
        }
        return min;
    }
}
