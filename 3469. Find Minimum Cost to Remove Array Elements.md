## 3469. Find Minimum Cost to Remove Array Elements

You are given an integer array nums. Your task is to remove all elements from the array by performing one of the following operations at each step until nums is empty:

Choose any two elements from the first three elements of nums and remove them. The cost of this operation is the maximum of the two elements removed.
If fewer than three elements remain in nums, remove all the remaining elements in a single operation. The cost of this operation is the maximum of the remaining elements.
Return the minimum cost required to remove all the elements.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [6,2,8,4]

Output: 12

Explanation:

Initially, nums = [6, 2, 8, 4].

In the first operation, remove nums[0] = 6 and nums[2] = 8 with a cost of max(6, 8) = 8. Now, nums = [2, 4].
In the second operation, remove the remaining elements with a cost of max(2, 4) = 4.
The cost to remove all elements is 8 + 4 = 12. This is the minimum cost to remove all elements in nums. Hence, the output is 12.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,3,3]

Output: 5

Explanation:

Initially, nums = [2, 1, 3, 3].

In the first operation, remove nums[0] = 2 and nums[1] = 1 with a cost of max(2, 1) = 2. Now, nums = [3, 3].
In the second operation remove the remaining elements with a cost of max(3, 3) = 3.
The cost to remove all elements is 2 + 3 = 5. This is the minimum cost to remove all elements in nums. Hence, the output is 5.

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 106

### Approach
Since we have to remove two element from the first three element, so remove either two min element or two largest element .  
we don't need to remove or do modification to delete, simply keep track of first index.  
After deleting, the number which has not to be deleted, store at (idx+2)th index. Before returning the min answer , undo the change done at (idx+2) index.

#### Java code
```
class Solution {
    HashMap<String,Integer> map;
    public int minCost(int[] nums) {
        int max=find(nums);
        map=new HashMap<>();
        return rec(nums,0);
    }
    private int rec(int nums[], int idx){
        if(idx==nums.length-2){ return Math.max(nums[idx],nums[idx+1]); }
        if(idx==nums.length-1){ return nums[idx]; }

        String key = idx+","+nums[idx];
        if(map.containsKey(key)){ return map.get(key); }

        int arr[]=new int[3];
        for(int i=idx; i<idx+3; i++){
            arr[i-idx]=nums[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int temp=nums[idx+2];
        // remove 2-3
        nums[idx+2] = arr[0];
        int a = arr[2] + rec(nums,idx+2);

        // remove 1-2
        nums[idx+2]=arr[2];
        int b = arr[1] + rec(nums,idx+2);
        // undo the change done at idx+2 index
        nums[idx+2]=temp;
        map.put(key,Math.min(a,b));
        return map.get(key);
    }
    private int find(int nums[]){
        int a=-1;
        for(int n : nums){
            a= Math.max(a,n);
        }
        return a;
    }
}
