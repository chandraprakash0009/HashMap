### 464. Can I Win

In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1 to 10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given two integers maxChoosableInteger and desiredTotal, return true if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return false. Assume both players play optimally.

 

Example 1:

Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11  
Output: false  
Explanation: 
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.  
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.  
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.  
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.  
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.  

Example 2:  

Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0  
Output: true  

Example 3:  

Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 1  
Output: true  
 

Constraints:  

1 <= maxChoosableInteger <= 20  
0 <= desiredTotal <= 300  

### Approach - 

In this question , it is asked which player will first reach to target.  
If player1 win in any of the case, then player1 will be the winner, hence return true.  
If player2 win in all the case, then player1 would be looser, hence return false;  

The catch is both player would reduce the same target.  

To ckeck if a number "n" has been used or not, we have taken a number "usedNumber". If the "n^th" bit of "usedNumber" is set, it means that number(n) has been used otherwise not used.
if not used then --> if you are using that number then find a number whose nth bit is set (i<<(n-1)) and do OR operation with the usedNumber to mark it as used.

1 -> 1 (1<<0)   
2 -> 10 (1<<1)   
3 -> 100 (1<<2)   
.  
.   
.  
n -> (1<<n-1)  

### Java code

```

public class Solution {
    private Map<Integer, Boolean> memo = new HashMap<>();

    public boolean canIWin(int maxChoosableInteger, int desiredTotal) {
        // Early checks
        if (desiredTotal <= 0) return true;

        // If the total sum of all numbers is less than the target, it's impossible to win
        int maxSum = (maxChoosableInteger * (maxChoosableInteger + 1)) / 2;
        if (maxSum < desiredTotal) return false;

        // Start recursive check
        return canWin(0, desiredTotal, maxChoosableInteger);
    }

    // usedNumbers is a bitmask: each bit i represents if number (i+1) is used
    private boolean canWin(int usedNumbers, int remainingTotal, int maxChoosableInteger) {
        if (memo.containsKey(usedNumbers)) {
            return memo.get(usedNumbers);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < maxChoosableInteger; i++) {
            int current = i + 1;
            int currentMask = 1 << i;

            if ((usedNumbers & currentMask) == 0) { // if number (i+1) is unused
                // If picking this number wins the game directly, or makes opponent lose
                if (current >= remainingTotal || !canWin(usedNumbers | currentMask, remainingTotal - current, maxChoosableInteger)) {
                    memo.put(usedNumbers, true);
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        memo.put(usedNumbers, false);
        return false;
    }

    // For testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution game = new Solution();
        System.out.println(game.canIWin(10, 11));  // Output: false
    }
}
